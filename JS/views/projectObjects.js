We wanted the ability to let people submit reviews for restaurants that they have been to, as well as submitting new restaurants if it is not within our system yet.</p>'

We were tasked with keeping track of not only the number of clicks that each item were to receive, but also calculate the number of times that item appeared, but also the click-through percentage, so that the marketing team would know which items were the most popular when presented. We also were tasked with showing the user a graph that would appear after their final selection, so that they could view how many times each item had been selected globaly.</p>'
